            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE End and Intention of our Writing and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling theſe Sheets, is to bring the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation</hi> into one compleat and entire Volume, containing all the neceſſaries thereunto belonging: For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto this hath been but ſhort and defectively performed, for it hath had the mishap, as many other Excellent Arts have had, <hi>ſc.</hi> To be Treated of by ſuch, as have not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally known the ſame; or elſe by thoſe, who have on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe concealed that, which in reality ought to have been diſcovered; ſo that the Authors hitherto extant are either filled wiih needleſs Preſcription, confuſed Workings, long and tedious Prolixity of Words and Circumlocutions, as we may ſay going about the Wood, or elſe have concealed the <hi>Ariadnean</hi> thread, which ſhould lead directly to the Practick, and ſo are only uſeful to thoſe, who have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeven Years Apprentiſhip to the imploy, then knowing what to chooſe and what to refuſe, and being able to pick the Roſe from among Thorns without pricking themſelves; for what a chargable and confuſed piece of work ſhould we have, were we to provide our ſelves with all thoſe Veſſels and Inſtruments deſcribed by <hi>Baker,</hi> for the making <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Aqua vitae,</hi> and <hi>Burning Spirits,</hi> and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from their Flegm; which, when done, would neither anſwer the end nor countervail the charge; for 'tis well known to all ingenious men, how difficult a thing
<pb facs="tcp:62757:3"/>it was to prepare a Spirit, which would fire Gun-powder, or be ſo purely Aetherial as to vaniſh in the Sun, 'till the uſe of Salt was known, by whoſe help we are able to perform it in large quantities, even in our common Stills with their Refrigeratory; And the moſt exact way that we ever ſaw is to work with Salts in a large Copper body with its Alembick and Refrigeratory in <hi>Baln.</hi> For with a lent heat you will have your Spirit perfectly deflegm'd, which for curioſity ſake, you may repeat a ſecond time, and then will it far excell any of thoſe made by the difficult Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before mentioned; and therefore why ſhould we go to ſo much charge and trouble, when it may be performed with ſo much facility and eaſe: And again, he is filled with abundance of Chymical Preparations, which have not the leaſt adherence to the making of Spirits; and ſo the mind of the Reader is diverted from that, which only ſhould be of Service to him; nay this is ſo apt to fill their heads with fancies, that they reſt unſatisfied 'till brought to Tryals, which either conſiderably exhauſt their Subſtance, or elſe take them from their buſineſs, nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wholy incapacitates them for the ſame; therefore ſhall we paſs by him; and come to conſider that of <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr. French</hi> indeed was a man of Ingenuity as his Works plainly ſhow, ſeing many curious things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, yet can we not wholly clear him from ſome of theſe defects.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>London Diſtiller,</hi> tho his Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there laid down are proper, yet, is he defective, both in the exact <hi>Modus</hi> of working, the ordering of the <hi>Waſh</hi> and <hi>Backs</hi> for a quick Fermentation, and upon a defect in their Working to bring them kindly forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as alſo in the great buſineſs of Rectification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:62757:3"/>which there is ſo great a noiſe about the Town; and indeed not without good reaſon, ſeing too too many are deficient in ſo advantageous a Secret as this is; yet is both he and <hi>French</hi> ſo ſcarce, that one of them is hardly to be gotten; and then again on the other hand, what we have formerly written in order to have ſupplied theſe defects was in ſuch general Terms and ſo ſhort, as that of it ſelf it was not ſufficient to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke any one prompt-perficient in the Art.</p>
            <p>Therefore we being deſired by ſeveral Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to communicate our Experience to the World, and ſo to ſupply the defects before mentioned, as much as in us lay, have upon a mature Conſideration thereunto condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with this Reſolution, that we would do it ſo as to capacitate any one, tho of a mean <hi>Genius</hi> and never brought up to the Art, in a little time by Study and Practice to be a compleat Maſter in the ſame, without having recourſe to any other Author; for which end we have compriſed it into a Pocket-Volume, that ſo it might be the more portable, and by conſequence ready for their Peruſal.</p>
            <p>Now that you may the better conceive what is therein contained, we ſhall in brief proceed, as follows; In the Firſt place, we have deſcribed the manner of Working in general, with all the neceſſary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then in a more particular way have ſhowed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and profitable ways of making <hi>Low-wines</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſix Materials; ſome by Decoction, and others without, giving you our Opinion which we beſt Approve of; we have indeed here laid down ſuch Rules in the ways of Brewing and Ordering the Waſh, as alſo in the bringing it into <hi>Low-wines,</hi> as that there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o
<pb facs="tcp:62757:4"/>Material in Nature that will yield a Vinor Spirit, but what may be wrought by ſome or other of them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus far brought, the time of their lying for their bettering is ſignified, together with the way of bringing them into <hi>Proof-goods;</hi> And then,</p>
            <p>In the Second we have ſhown the exact way of Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by and through ſuch <hi>Mediums,</hi> as that they are brought into moſt excellent <hi>Stuff,</hi> and if the uſe of <hi>Tartar, Sulphur</hi> whether common or that of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> joyned with the ſweet Salt were known, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſweet and pleaſant Spirits might be brought forth; but more eſpecially by the help of our <hi>Sal Panariſtos</hi> might Engliſh goods be ſo ordered as that in Taſt and Smell they might be little Inferior to thoſe of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and equal in Vertue to the Engliſh Conſtitutions; becauſe of their Climatary Affinity, Concerning which, we have not only given you our own Experience, but alſo the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the famous <hi>Radolphus Glauber;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo prepared we have likewiſe ſhown their various uſes in making <hi>Cordial-Waters</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third, we have ſhown all the Neceſſary and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Compoſitions in the Art, according to the greater and leſſer <hi>Pondus;</hi> to which we have added many rare ones of our own, together with an <hi>Uſque-bagh-Royal</hi> never Publiſhed before, and alſo the way of Dulcifying and Perfuming theſe Wares or Liquors, ſo that they may be the moſt Commodious for Sail.</p>
            <p>And in the Fourth, we have moreover ſhown the True and Genuine way of making <hi>Powers</hi> by three noble <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums, ſc.</hi> a <hi>Purified Sal Armoniack</hi> the <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb facs="tcp:62757:4"/>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and <hi>Sal Panariſtos,</hi> together with their Vertues, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Doſe, for the Benefit of ſuch, as languiſh under the burthen of Refractory Diſeaſes, and can find no Relief from the common Preſcriptions; for we have through much Expence and Labor by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God thereunto attained, and by more than Ten Years Experience knowing their admirable Vertues to be ſuch, as to relieve, when paſt the hopes of other means; we thought we could no better befriend the World, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Ingenious Lovers of Art, than freely to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their Compoſition that ſo they might the better Judge of their Nature and Property; and altho we have not attributed ſo many Vertues thereunto, as others have done to more Inferiour <hi>Powers,</hi> yet this hath been on purpoſe omitted for two Reaſons: The Firſt, becauſe we hate fruitleſs repetitions, or to ſpeak more of the Vertue and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of things, than we know they will really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; for we would rather that a Medicine ſhould Cure Ten Diſeaſes, when we ſpeak but of Five, than to ſpeak of Forty, when 'twill very rarely Cure One; and eſpecially in theſe ſeing their Adminiſtration is general and ſafe without the leaſt difficulty: The other is, becauſe we have looked upon it as a grand Error too often Committed by our <hi>New Compiler,</hi> to attribute that to one ſleight or common Preparation, which can but in due right be aſcribed to the higheſt <hi>Specifick</hi> or <hi>Arcanum,</hi> nay even to the <hi>Univerſal</hi> it ſelf; therefore, tho we know that ours are farr ſuperior, yet were we reſolved therein to be very cautious, leaſt others ſhould ſuppoſe us guilty of the like default.</p>
            <p>Now, what we have further to ſay, is, that we have great reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>In which we Treat of the Art of Diſtillation in general, together with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIRST, We think it convenient to define the word <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> and then to ſhew the uſe thereof; the word Diſtillation imports no more than <hi>a dropping down by little and little;</hi> but the uſe and end thereof, is in the firſt place to Extract the Spirituality from bodies, when macerated or open'd by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that we may truly ſay this Art is for changing of groſs and thick bodies into a thin and Spiritual Nature, by which Action the pure <hi>Effluvia</hi> are ſeparated from the more terrene, Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, and impure <hi>Faeces;</hi> and that only by the help of heat; they being thereby reſolved into a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, are elevated to the Helm, where they are in part condenſed by the cold, which is fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62757:10"/>as they run out of the Beck into the Worm, through the Refrigerating Tub, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come clear and lucid: This is the end of Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general; but in Particular, 'tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a threefold reſpect, ſc. <hi>Diſtillation, Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and <hi>Extraction; <hi>Diſtillation</hi> is a converting of bodies</hi> (as before defined) <hi>into Water, Oyl and Spirit; <hi>Rectification</hi> is a reiterated Elevoriation, by which the before mentioned are ſeparated from their more hidden and internal Impurities; and the Spiritual, Eſſential humidity, from the more Phlegmatick and Aqueous: And <hi>Extraction</hi> is by the help of ſome pure Spirit to draw forth that virtue out of bodies, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would not ſo eaſily admit of Maceration, or of being ſo overcome, as to be brought into Spirituallity:</hi> Now in bodies very compact, this is beſt perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cohobation,</hi> which is a returning the Liquor upon the body whence Extracted, and Diſtilling it off again; which muſt ſo often be repeated as till you've obtained the deſired Virtues; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to accompliſh all that is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a <hi>Diſtiller,</hi> and indeed to make the Art compleat, and the Diſcourſe thereof full, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we intend not to ſpeak of any thing but what is pertinent thereunto, we ſhall referr thoſe who deſire to know the Nature of other Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to our <hi>Chymicus Rationalis,</hi> where they are fully and amply handled, and ſo paſſing by the uſe and Definition of this Art, we ſhall now come to the Practick.</p>
               <p>In which we find that it requires a great many Conveniences, as a fit Work-houſe, proper Stills, Coppers, Backs, Inſtruments and Materials, all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62757:10"/>which, to be rightly managed, require ſeveral hands, if any conſiderable draught of Goods is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be made, ſo from hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this Art is not rightly to be carried on without a conſiderable large Fund, but when ſo managed 'twill repay the Owner, or Maſter with conſiderable Intereſt; which is the reaſon that many of them get ſuch plentiful Eſtates, at which none ought to grudge, ſeeing 'tis got with ſuch juſt gain, and that the Golden Cap is obtained by hard Labour: And beſides, there's a Proverb in <hi>England, win Gold and wear it;</hi> and why therefore may not theſe enjoy the ſame, ſeeing nothing is more labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than this Art, when rightly followed; and what they thereby obtain, we may, as it were, ſay, is got out of the Fire: but before we proceed particularly to give every one the Knowledge of theſe Profits, we ſhall ſpeak of the neceſſaries whereby we are inabled to go to work, otherwiſe without them we may be ſure there'll be none at all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the Work-houſe, we beſt eſteem it when ſomething ſpacious, at leaſt 16, 18, or 20 Foot in breadth; and 24, 26, 28, or 30, in length; eſpecially, where you deſign to work conſiderable quantities. The manner of Erecting the Carcaſe, with the proportionable height, and way of covering it, we ſhall leave to the Ingenuity of the Work-man, to whom it belongs, and give you our opinion of the accompliſhment of what is required in it: Thus, at the utmoſt end we adviſe that a Copper be ſet up, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Brewers;</hi> except you deſign to prepare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62757:11"/>your Liquor in your large Still, which will be ſomewhat troubleſome, and indeed a great hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to buſineſs, if you intend to work it off twice a day, as uſually is done: Now by your Copper you muſt have your Maſhing Tub, to maſh in; and under that large Receivers, and over upon the Rafters you may have a Cooler; and again under the Coolers large Backs, one for the ſtronger Wort, the other for the ſmaller; and ſo order'd, as that it may run into either; now from theſe large Backs, you muſt convey Leaden Pipes unto Receiving Backs for Stores, and from your ſtore ones to the Waſh-backs, which ought always to be placed oppoſite to your great Stills, for the more ready filling of them; now this conveyance is very convenient, from Back to Back; for by this means you may always be ſupplied with Waſh; and eſpecially if you command it by the turning of a Cock, otherwiſe you muſt make uſe of a ſtrong Cork with a ſtring above it, that ſo you may pluck it out when you pleaſe. Now theſe Backs, as they are ſet into the Earth, muſt be well daubed about with temper'd Clay, or put in a thin Bed thereof; for this is ſaid to preſerve them tight and warm: theſe muſt have Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In hanging your Stills you muſt obſerve, to place them on the ſame ſide that your Copper is on, that ſo your Backs may be the better ranged together without Confuſion; let them be as near the end as they'll poſſibly ſtand; and let two ſtand together, that ſo one Flew may ſerve for the Conveyance of both their ſmoaks; and in the firſt place you muſt obſerve to place them ſo, as that the lower end of the Worm may be 14 Inches from the ground, that ſo a Can may freely be placed under, and taken away when full: 'tis better an Inch too high than a quarter of one too low; and for proportioning your Still to any height, you muſt let in your Aſh-hole into the ground; which in length and breadth muſt be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to that of the Still; for one of ſix Barrels ten or twelve Inches in breadth is ſufficient; and for one of Eight or ten Barrels, it muſt be Twelve or Fourteen at the leaſt; the which are two very good Sizes; the length muſt be proportioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Grate and Door, ſomewhat ſloping for the more eaſie commanding the Aſhes. And having proceeded thus far, you muſt obſerve not to make the Fire place too broad; your Grate muſt be made of thick heavy Bars, exactly out, of an even length, the ends ſomewhat flatted upon flat bars, and broad, flat bars muſt lie even with their upper edges, that ſo the Shovel, Slice or Rake may not jam in them, although they lie looſe, to be taken in or out upon occaſion as any of them melt off: the broad flat Bars muſt be continued right one to another, even to the mouth of the door; and the door muſt be of Iron, as the Brewers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62757:12"/>Coopers are; let your mouth and fire place be built all of broad Tiles, for theſe better bear the fury of the Fire than Bricks: And when your Fire place is of its proper height, and at one end a convenient ſloping hole left for the Fire to play up in, let your Still be placed upon the Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, in ſuch a way as that it may have a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for the Liquor to run out of the Cock; and upon tryal let it be cloſely work'd upon to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that ſo the Fire may only play at the Flew; and obſerve to place your Cocks through the Wall, that ſo the Liquor or Waſh may run out into the proper receiving Backs, without annoying the Still-houſe. Let there be a Wheel-vent made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſmoak and flame, at leaſt five, ſix, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or eight Inches, as your ſtill is in bigneſs which taking the Fire throws it round the Still and brings it into the great Flew or Chimney 'tis generally ordered, that the Wheel-vent ſhoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now every Wort that comes is pump'd up out of the under Back into the Cooler, there to Cool; and then from the Cooler into the Waſh-Backs, there to remain 'till all the three Worts come together. By the way obſerve, that you neither Hop nor Boyl, as for Beer; now when they are down in the Backs, and in a proper coolneſs and fit to be ſet; then add good Yeaſt enough to work it very well, as for Ale; and as the Yeaſt riſes up beat it down again, and keep the ſame all in; and let it work three, four, or five days, according to the ſeaſon of the Year, Temperament of your Back, when ſet, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Diſtiller.</p>
               <p>If a Back be ſet either too cold or too hot, 'tis thus holpen, by adding either hot or cold Liquors, to bring it unto a good temperature; in the Winter time, in extream cold weather when it flats and goes backward, and will come to no good Head; you may again promore it's
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62757:17"/>Fermentation by adding ſome of thoſe things preſcribed in that of <hi>Molàſſes:</hi> Now if you can exactly know the time of the Waſh's being come, then you may take off your thick Yeaſt, to ſet other Backs with: But if not, then muſt you take with you theſe ſigns, ſc.: the working it ſelf down flat, and then the thick Yeaſt ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bottom, that ſo what lies on the top will be but a kind of an hoary or Yeaſty Head: You muſt obſerve that your Waſh be neither ſowre nor ſweet, but in a <hi>Medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both; for't will then be moſt profitable for Diſtillation; but ſome ſay, that being taken in its higheſt Curle, before it begin to flat, and the Yeaſt and all Stilled, it gives the moſt Spirit; the way whereof will be alſo hereafter ſhown.</p>
               <p>The third we call the <hi>Dutch way,</hi> becauſe moſtly uſed in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which is, the Fermenting of the Corn; which to do, you muſt proceed thus; Take freſh ground Malt, made of Wheat, Barley, or Buck Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and put it into the Oyl Tubs before deſcribed, pouring thereon as much cold Water, as will ſerve for mixtion and commixtion, and then alſo pouring as much warm Water, as will ſuffice for making the mixture moiſt and thin, alſo warm; for it muſt be neither hot nor cold, but in the <hi>Medium</hi> between both; which being done, and well rowed up, mix therewith ſome new Barm, and cover it with its Cover and Cloth very warm; which being expoſed to the Heat will in a ſhort ſpace begin to Ferment; therefore you are not to fill your Veſſels, above three
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62757:17"/>quarters full; this you muſt leave until Fermented, and the mixture deſcends, which for the moſt part will be on the third or fourth day; and then is it ready for Diſtillation; but 'tis generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by thoſe which are not uſed to this way, that the Malt being put into the Still Cakes and burns to the bottom, to the deſtruction both of the ſame, and <hi>Low-wines,</hi> which come off with a burnt taſte; which to prevent, there are two ways; the one is to preſs forth the Liquor from the Grains, and to Diſtill the ſame; the other is by our new Invention, which will be ſhown here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; for we ſaw that all our Experiments made in a boyling Bath did not in the leaſt burn; but that all the <hi>Low-wines</hi> came off very ſweet and luſcious in taſte, and pleaſant in ſmell.</p>
               <p>The Fourth and Laſt, is the <hi>Glauberian</hi> way, which is thus; Firſt you muſt after this manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your Corn, whether Barley, Rie, Oats, or Wheat; ſc. ſteep it in ſweet Water for ſome days, then place it, that it may ſprout after the ſame manner as Corn is Malted for the making of Beer; turn it well for a certain time, leſt it be corrupted by too much heat; then when it is well ſprouted, ſpread it abroad, that it may preſently cool, and 'twill never ſowre.</p>
               <p>But if you would uſe it preſently, then take as much of it as your Deſtillation will require, and in a Kettle full of Water, boyl it ſo long, till the Grains are broken, then pour it into a Wooden Veſſel, and when it is luke-warm, add to it the freſh Dregs or Grounds of Beer, and let it Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when it has fermented enough, which is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62757:18"/>uſually at the end of two or three days, then <hi>Brandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> is made in a common Still, by Deſtillation from that Corn; what remains in the Still will ſerve to feed Oxen, Cows, Hogs, or other Cattle.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Brandy-wine</hi> which proceeds from thence muſt be Rectified, as the way is; and by this means 'tis render'd more ſweet and grateful to the reliſh, than any other <hi>Brandy</hi> made of Corn: the Reaſon is this, That all Bread Corn, of which <hi>Brandy-wine</hi> ought to be prepared, if it be put to Ferment preſently after ſoftening, is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Still, by boyling, reduced into a Pap, and ſo being corrupted by aduſtion produces a ſtinking <hi>Brandy-wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this protuberating and burſt Corn cannot be burnt, and therefore makes good <hi>Brandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 'tis obſervable that that <hi>Brandy</hi> made from Wheat-Corn, is the moſt near of any other from any Grain whatſoever to that of <hi>Gallia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let thus much at preſent ſuffice concerning Corn, becauſe the diſtinct rules of bringing it into <hi>Low-wines, Proof Spirits,</hi> and <hi>rectified goods,</hi> will be laid down in their proper places; we ſhall therefore now proceed to the ſecond, Head; ſc. <hi>Molaſſes, Sugar,</hi> and <hi>Honey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Molaſſes,</hi> you need to do no more, than down with it into the Backs (ſeeing for promiſe-ſake we muſt open ſo many truths) and add thereto three or four times its weight of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, prepared as in the ſecond Head; <hi>i. e.</hi> to every Hundred of <hi>Molaſſes</hi> thirty ſix, forty, or forty ſix Gallons of Liquor; according as you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62757:18"/>will have it ſmall or rich of the <hi>Molaſſes;</hi> for you muſt obſerve, that the ſtronger it is, the longer 'twill be before it comes to Fermentation; and this, if it be not well Fermented, will yield but poorly, <hi>i. e.</hi> very little quantity of Spirits; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it abundantly nicer to be wrought than that of Malt; and eſpecially in theſe cold Climates; for you muſt obſerve to ſet your Back at once in a good temper; being not ſo well to be holpen by hot or cold Liquors, as that of Corn; and you muſt have good ſtore of Yeaſt, or Ferment to Head it well at once, or elſe it will not come on; but if you uſe Waſh inſtead of Water and Tilts, the Grounds of very Strong Beer, will help its Fermentation on ſo, that abundantly leſs Yeaſt will ſerve; and you muſt obſerve, that it ſtands, eſpecially in the Winter time, in a very warm place; and if in the ſecond day it ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to come well on, the which it will not, if ſet either too hot or too cold; then you muſt have ready by you a Pot of very ſtrong Muſtard, with a Horſe-Raddiſh and good Onion, and the value of an Egg, or two of theſe muſt be caſt in; you may dip the Onion and Horſe-Raddiſh in the Muſtard; and this will highly prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62757:19"/>Miſtreſs may and will be your beſt help: For you muſt know that when it is truly Fermented, you muſt take it in the right nick, neither too high nor too flat, neither too ſweet nor too ſowre; for by any extream, you may loſe of your quantity of Spirit, as well as by the want of due Fermentation; therefore if a Back of <hi>Molaſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Reader! make not ſtrange of this working over of <hi>Molaſſes</hi> a ſecond time, ſeeing it hath been often done; and we are credibly informed by a Perſon of Ingenuity, that in <hi>Barbados</hi> and thoſe Iſlands where the Sugar Canes are in large quantity, <hi>they take the <hi>Molaſſes,</hi> foul <hi>Sugars,</hi> and their <hi>Canes,</hi> and Ferment them together with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the former Diſtillation, and upon a defect of Fermentation they caſt in ſome Wood-Aſhes newly made; together with ſome live Coals. He farther ſaid, that when it is almoſt brought to its height in Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, they add five Gallons more of <hi>Molaſſes,</hi> and then ſtir and Ferment, as before, and then again five Gallons, always keeping it in Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with other reiterate additions, proceed until it is very rich of the <hi>Molaſſes:</hi>
                  </hi> But if ſo, than are they in this Caſe beholding to their Climate for the heat, which helps on their Fermentation for here that would not be performed under a long and tedious time, therefore we ſhall omit it but as for the uſing their remains we much

               <p>Honey muſt be mixed with four, five, ſix, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or eight parts of warm water, and diſſolved; and then to the Solution you muſt add Ferment, as was ſpoken concerning Malt, which afterward muſt be left covered in ſome heat for to be Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; being fit for Diſtillation when it comes to wax hot. Now know that too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Honey makes a very ſlow Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> Of ſome Weeks or Months; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for acceleration ſake we adviſe, that a greater quantity of Water be added; although otherwiſe it yields plenty of Spirits, but ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; which therefore we would have no body to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill, as being unprofitable, unleſs any one know how to take away the ungratefulneſs thereof; which will be more largely ſhown in the Chapter of Rectification: <hi>Low-wines, Proof goods,</hi> and <hi>Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits,</hi> may be made from thoſe <hi>Meads</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in our <hi>Britannean Magazine</hi> of <hi>Wines;</hi> and moſt excellent and flavorous Spirits they are indeed: Moreover as to what concerns Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, it may be performed by what is laid down of <hi>Molaſſes</hi> and <hi>Honey;</hi> and therefore being need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to repeat it, we ſhall paſs on to another Head.</p>
               <p>Now as to Cyder, Perry, and Artificial Wines, together with ſuch Liquors as may be made from <hi>Engliſh</hi> growths, according to the general way commonly known, as alſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62757:20"/>they being well Fermented, and by Age come to be ripe and fine, there is no difficulty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there from a generous Spirit. Note, that Cyders yield but little quantity of Spirit, let them be made never ſo fine by age; therefore 'tis requiſite that you again open them, and bring them to a freſh Ferment, and then they will yield plentifully; alſo when they are declining, prick'd, ropy or flat, it is requiſite that they be again helped into a Fermentative State, by ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as will meaſurably revive them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Whites of Eggs and Flour will do it; or ſome <hi>Alkaliſated Calx;</hi> and if not, then muſt you proceed to your common way, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which, and warmth, new Cyder may be ſo brought, as in five, ſix, or ſeven days it will be fit to be Diſtilled; and ſo of the reſt. Now among many <hi>fine Goods</hi> excellent <hi>Stuff</hi> may be made from ſound Fruits, eſpecially Cyder, that ſo with ſmall additions good <hi>Brandies</hi> may be made; therefore why ſhould we contemn the perfect knowledge of <hi>Molaſſes</hi> and <hi>Cyder-Spirits,</hi> ſeeing by a little Induſtry great things may thereby be performed: But what is here ſaid being ſufficient for all kind of Fruits, ſeeing the Doctrine of Fermentation is elſewhere more largely laid down; paſſing this by we ſhall come to the fourth Head.</p>
               <p>Raiſins, Figs and other Foreign Fruits, may either be ſtamped in a great Stone Mortar, or put down whole into your Backs, adding warm Liquor to them, as in the ſecond Head of Corn, and as the Back is fit to be ſet, add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62757:20"/>your common Ferment, and with a due heat they will kindly come forward, and as the Fruit ariſes at the top, you may beat them down again; but if they work not kindly in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third day, then you may add in a Ball of Whiting, or a ſmall portion of <hi>Calx Vive</hi> or <hi>Argell,</hi> not forgeting the helps before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. We alſo have ſeen excellent effects from <hi>Chryſtals</hi> of <hi>Tartar:</hi> For thus we have made moſt excellent Wines, according as is touched at in our <hi>Britannean Magazine.</hi> Now as ſoon as they are fully Fermented, which will ſometimes be a day ſooner than at other times, you may Diſtill them, their Juice being either preſt out, or the Fruit put into the Still, as we in our Tryals have ſometimes done; but then we have obſerved often to take off the Head, and ſtir them, till ready to Boyl, for fear they ſhould Cake: But if you make uſe of our new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentioned in the Diſtilling of Corn, you ſave all this trouble: The manner of bringing theſe into <hi>Low wines, Proof goods,</hi> and <hi>Rectified Spirits,</hi> will be deſcribed in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Now as to Foreign Wines and their Lees, 'tis by us obſervable, that the former being well Fermented and become fine and generous, will give ſo noble a Spirit in Diſtillation, that we highly doubt whether a pint thereof may be got amongſt all the <hi>Brandy Merchants</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and becauſe their <hi>Baſis</hi> may be ſold in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts at a greater price, than when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled; their uſual way therefore is to Diſtill ſuch Wines, as will not keep the year about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62757:21"/>roping or turning ſowre, or ſuch as are ſmall and defective, in compariſon to what they are at other Vintages, wherefore we conceive that moſt Brandies are made ſuch Years, as are wet and cold, ſo that the Fruit of the Vine, or Grapes are not for want of the bounteous or friendly raies of the Sun brought to their true maturity; from whence only proceed the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fragrancy to the Wine; for thereby only is the Specificated Sulphur brought forth apparently in its Genuine Nature: Now what Nature doth not perform, they endeavour to ſupply by Art, ſc. by ſtumming of them, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by an Artificial heat into a ſtrong Fermentation; and to give ſavours, they often uſe the Tincture or Eſſence of appropriated Herbs; and being fine or fined by Glaſs, they rack them off for Sail; concerning which Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wines, there is no Nation that uſeth it more than the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for altho' in <hi>France</hi> they generally buy the ſmalleſt priſed Wines, new and rough, yet by their ſweets, and Perfumes do they bring and advance them to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able price: And theſe alſo thus managed give a very good and pleaſant Spirit or Brandy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all times fit for Diſtillation; but that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit drawn from the Lees will not by far be ſo pleaſant, as this from the Wines, altho' both out of one and the ſame Cask, as will be ſhown hereafter; therefore paſſing this by here, we ſhall come to ſhow the way of ordering Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wines and Lees, which is thus:</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62757:21"/>
               <p>You muſt add to your Lees as much warm Liquor as will diſſolve them, and then with Stum and warmth, or the common Ferment, bring them into Fermentation, and if thick, you may preſs out the moiſture, and Diſtill it: But in the Viniferious Countries they mix ſmall, new, and other decayed Wines therewith, and ſo bring them into Fermentation with ſome other ſmall addition of Liquor, and then Diſtill them. So that it is from theſe mixtures that the Violet, Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, and other pleaſant taſtes proceed: For as the Ingenious <hi>Glauber</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Juice</hi> of <hi>Grapes is nothing elſe but a ſweet Salt, which by Fermonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becomes more Tart; nay indeed more ſowre, as its Inviſible, Vital, and Internal Spirituality hath its more volatile particles exhauſted;</hi> but ſeeing we have more largely treated of Savours in the <hi>Chapter of Rectification,</hi> we ſhall omit it here, and proceed to the laſt Head.</p>
               <p>The Fermentation of Herbs is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a twofold reſpect, ſc. either as they are worked <hi>per ſe</hi> by a common Ferment; or by Sugar and Honey; <hi>per ſe</hi> is when the Herb, Flower or Berry, is bruiſed in a large Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, or Alabaſter Mortar, with a Wooden Peſtle, and then warm Liquor, or Water poured thereon, and the Ferment or Yeaſt added ſufficient to ſtir it up or quicken it ſo as to bring it into a true and perfect Fermentation: <hi>By Sugar or Honey is,</hi> as you Diſtill from the Herb its Juice in a cold Still, to which, being put in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Veſſel, you add Herbs, Fruits or Flowers, well bruiſed, and to every Gallon of Liquor a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62757:22"/>Pound, two, three, or four of Sugar or Honey, as you will have it in ſtrength; then being ſtirred well together, let them be covered cloſe and warm; and let them ſtand till they Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, work, froth and flower, and ſmell very fragrant, and become fit to Diſtill; and if occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires this Fermentation may be promoted by ſome of the precited Fermentatives. Obſerve that if you work roots either of theſe ways you muſt ſlice them thin before you put them in.</p>
               <p>Thus have we run through theſe ſix Heads, in which is comprehended all that is needful to be treated of concerning Fermentation, only we think it requiſite to add theſe following rules, <hi>Firſt, <hi>That in all things that are to be wrought by Fermentation, the whole mixture muſt be well united;</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the Back muſt be temperately ſet;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That you muſt add a convenient quantity of Yeast or Ferment, and keep them warm:</hi>
                  </hi> All theſe muſt be diligently weighed, and accurately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if ever you intend to exalt your materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to the deſired end; concerning which you ſhall hear what the famous <hi>Radolphus Glauber</hi> ſaith, Where he ſpeaks of the defects in Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; <hi>the which be ſays ſometimes proceed from too much cold, or hot Water put in, or the Veſſels not being well covered, by which means the cold Air is let in, whence the Fermentation is hindred, and conſequently the Diſtillation of the Spirit; for by the help of Fermentation the burning Spirit of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables is ſet at liberty, without which it cannot be done: Alſo the Diſtillation is hindred by too much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62757:22"/>haſte, as well as by too much delay; for if you begin to Diſtill before the time,</hi> viz. <hi>Fermentation not being yet perfected, you ſhall have but few Spirits; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the better part is, by many that are unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, caſt to the Swine, but without any great loſs, if the matter were Malt; becauſe that Swine are fed therewith: but not ſo if other Vegetables were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Diſtillation: Alſo too much ſlowneſs where the Matter begins to be ſowre before it be Distilled, yields very few Spirits, that which often happens whilest Herbs and Flowers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are out of Ignorance left in Fermentation three, four, five, or more Weeks, before they be Diſtilled; for the greateſt part of the Spirit is then turned to Vinegar, which would not be ſo very ill done, if ſo be theſe men knew how to Clarifie the remainders, and turn it into Vinegar, that nothing thereof might be loſt; for the Vinegars of Herbs, Flowers, Seeds and Roots are not to be contemned. And ſo often times (a thing to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) the better parts, if they be Spices, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things, is lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The matter of the Diſtillation, and other choice things, as Seeds and Herbs are caſt away with loſs; wherefore for Admonition ſake, I was willing to add ſuch things that the Operators may have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to conſider the matter a little more profoundly with themſelves, or at leaſt of learning the Art of Diſtilling from Country Men, who do not ſuffer their Malt to Putrefie, grow Sowre or Mouldy, before they fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Diſtillations; but preſently Fermentation being made (the third or fourth day) begin their Diſtillation.</hi> Which we ſhall now come to treat of, and firſt of bringing them into Low-wines.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62757:23"/>
               <p>For the making of which you muſt obſerve two things; the firſt is, that in all things, which are Liquid, as Beer, Cyder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt put your before deſcribed Pump into the Back in which it is, directing your Spout to that Still which you deſign to charge; and let one hand Pump and another pair of hands row up, that ſo the bottom may come into the Still, and when filled ſo high as the upper Nails, let down your Head on the Still; but put not the Beck or Noſe as yet into the Worm; for Reaſons hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; then, the Still being charg'd, proceed to the making of your Fire, which is beſt of Coals or dry Cleft-Wood, and very ſtrong, until it begins to boyl, as a pot going over; then muſt you ſet the Pipe of the Head into the Worm, and as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to drop and run a ſmall ſtream into the Can, then immediately muſt you throw damping under the Still, which is, the Aſhes that fall under your Grate and kept wet for that end, for if you ſhould not do ſo, it would boyl over into the Worm, and ſo ſtop and foul the ſame; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proceeded thus far, your Still being in a good temper, you muſt begin to lute all faſt with a Paſte made of Whiting and Rie-flower: you muſt exactly lute round the Neck of your Still, and by ſo doing you will keep in that Breath, in which is the Spirit; and as you have paſted the Neck, ſo muſt you alſo paſte the Pipe and Worm, wherein it goes; that is to ſay, exactly to cloſe the Joint: You muſt alſo obſerve ſo to govern your Fire, that you bring your Still to work ſo, as that the Stream may run the bigneſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62757:23"/>of a large Gooſe or Turkey Quill; and being thus brought to work, it muſt be continued till all the ſtrength is off, and what runs is a ſtinking Flegm; thus are you to proceed in your firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, the ſecond ſhall be ſhown hereafter.</p>
               <p>As to the other thing which is to be obſerved, it is in the Diſtilling of thoſe things, which are not preſſed forth from their Corporiety; but thick and thin muſt all go into the Still together; and this generally will Cake, although you take all the care you can to ſtir it before it works; by which means we have known the bottom of a New Still burnt out; which to prevent, as we have done in our tryals, you muſt obſerve, that in making your Still, two Inches above the turning, and juſt even with the cloſure of the Brick-work, you muſt have your Still turned with a very large Verge, and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hammer'd for the upper part to ſhut in, which muſt be proportioned round up, as in other Stills, with a Neck exactly fit for the Head, on which you muſt place two Rings, juſt oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſo at any time upon occaſion it may be eaſily lifted off, to which Verge you muſt fit a very ſtrong Iron Hoop, the upper part of which muſt have three ſtrong Rings in it, that ſo upon occaſion a Rope may be faſtned to it; to the under part you muſt lace or brace on your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, which muſt come within two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the bottom, as alſo within two Inches of every ſide; then place your hoop on the Verge, and charge your Still, the Corporiety will be therein received, and the Liquor will paſs to fill up the vacancy; then ſhut down the Shoulders of your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62757:24"/>Still, and lute faſt with a Paſte made of <hi>Calx Vive</hi> and Whites of Eggs, or fine Flower and Sand, or thick well boiled Starch and Sand: Let down your Head, but you muſt not yet put the Noſe into the Worm, but make a good Fire, as you were before directed, and ſo cauſe your Liquor to boyl and before it works great part of the <hi>Wild Gaſs</hi> or unruly Spirit will go off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly, as much indeed as can be expected, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Liquor had been decocted and cooled in: Now as the Beck, Noſe, or end of the Pipe begins to drop, you muſt put it into the Worm and lute faſt, as before directed, as alſo the Neck of the Stills and your Still being brought to work, you muſt in all things proceed in the Extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>Low-wines,</hi> as before laid down in the firſt Obſervation: and this alſo is to be Noted, that ſome Malt, Grain, and Fruits will in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining run off a Can, two, or three of Proof Spirit, and then it generally runs long: Others ſometimes runs not at the beginning ſo fully Proof, and yet will yield indifferently well. Thus your <hi>Low wines</hi> being Diſtilled, you let them lie ten or fourteen days, to enrich themſelves; for in that time they get by lying, and ſome think that if they lie longer they loſe, as alſo <hi>Proof Spirits,</hi> except they lie very warm: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may, as we have found by experience, be ſo order'd, as that they may be the more mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and better themſelves thereby. Theſe rules being ſufficient for the Extracting all kind of <hi>Low-wines,</hi> and the more eſpecially, if you make Uſe of our curious Invention, before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62757:24"/>for that by it theſe benefits will accrew; Firſt you are not troubled; with the moving, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or rowing your matter in the Still; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you need not fear your Still's being burnt, or your Wines getting any aduſtion or Evil Tang, for they will come over ſweet, pleaſant, and fragrant; Thirdly and Laſtly, you have this advantage, that you may remove the ſhoulders of your Still, and faſten a Rope in the Iron Hoop, and by means of a Pully lift your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at once out, which may be received into a Coule and bore away; and the Waſh let out the common way; and if your matter be either Wheat or Barley, the Grains, though they have been in the Still, will be very good Food for Cattle or Swine. Note that after this method, only uſing a Tin-pan made fit for the Verge, and an Inch or two of vacancy between, whereby to put in the Water, may you have an Artificial <hi>Balneum</hi> for rectifying your Spirits. We ſhall now proceed to the ſecond Extraction, which is thus;</p>
               <p>Take two or three Cans of Water, put them into your Still, and a ſmall handful of Salt; and charge your ſtill with <hi>Low-wines</hi> to a convenient height; let down your Head, and give Fire; then put your Beck into the Worm, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proceed till all is over; the which you may know by the weakneſs of that which comes.</p>
               <p>Obſerve. You may alſo uſe a ſmall portion of ſome Herb, which hath a proper Signature with the Vine: And it is a general cuſtom among the <hi>Diſtillers,</hi> in order to make their Spirits hot, ſtrong, and fiery in the mouth, to uſe Spaniſh
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62757:25"/>Grains, which are ſold by the <hi>Druggiſts,</hi> which do accompliſh their end; but with little other advantage to the Spirit: Therefore do we reject it, tho' a thing ſo much practiſed, ſeeing more agreeable and pleaſant ways are eaſily to be found. Now we ſhall reveal one thing more, which will be helpful to the <hi>Diſtiller,</hi> which is, in taking away part of the groſs Sulphur, from whence much of the Evil Tang proceedeth; and 'tis thus: Take a pound of Wool, waſh it exceeding clean, and dry it, and with a loop hang it in the Head of the Still, in which the oleous parts, aſcending, will be inſorbed; and when the Operation is over, waſh clean, dry, and keep it for the like ſervice: Having thus finiſhed the ſecond Extraction, we think it not amiſs to ſhow what quantity of <hi>Low-wines, Proof goods,</hi> and <hi>fine Spirits</hi> may be Extracted from a Quarter of Malt.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, that in the firſt place, 'twill make about Fifty Gallons, or ſomething more than three Barrels of Waſh, which in the firſt Extraction will make thirty two, thirty four, or thirty ſix Gallons of <hi>Low-wines;</hi> and theſe if you let them lie, will in the ſecond Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yield eleven or twelve Gallons of <hi>Proof Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> nay ſometimes (through the goodneſs and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Malt) thirteen; eſpecially if in the ſecond Extraction you add ſome Water into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Note alſo, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> receive their <hi>Low-wines, Proof,</hi> and <hi>Fine Goods</hi> in Cans; but the <hi>Dutch</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62757:25"/>object againſt this way, ſaying that it is diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous; becauſe the Spirit is exhauſted through the Magnetick or Attractive, property of the Air; therefore they place large receiving Veſſels their full height or more in the Ground, ſo as to place thick boards over them, in which they have two holes; the one for a Funnel to receive the <hi>Low-Wines</hi> or <hi>Proof Goods;</hi> the other to put in an Hand-Pump, to Pump them out when they pleaſe; which indeed is very commodious, not only for the Reaſons mentioned, but alſo becauſe the Still may be ſet lower, (a Funnel requiring not ſo large a ſpace or height, as a Can) whereby it may be the better and eaſier commanded.</p>
               <p>Thus having run through what was promiſed in this Chapter, we ſhall here conclude the ſame, and paſs on to Rectification.</p>

                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62757:27"/>good Spirit, not unlike to that which is made out of the Lees of Wine, in taſte, odour, and other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Which Art although it be not known to all, yet it doth not follow, that it is impoſſible.</hi> To which Opinion we can the more freely aſſent, ſeeing that we, by our former experienced tryals, which were about five years ago, at which time we had a good quantity of our <hi>Percipiolum of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> by us, have made moſt excellent <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Artificial Brandies</hi> from the chief Heads before mentioned: Concerning which <hi>Tartar,</hi> we have many Myſteries to write; but for obligation ſake muſt reſerve ſome of them; as being aſſiſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by a <hi>Glauberian;</hi> but however we ſhall lay the thing before your view by repeating the words of the Famous Author. <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 139. <q>Take white or red <hi>Tartar</hi> (for both of them being well mundified, are as good one as the other) diſſolve it in Water, and ſeparate all its groſs Sulphur, by a certain precipitating mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This impurity abiding in the Water, is to be ſeparated from the precipitated Tartar; by pouring out the Water, the which <hi>(Tartar)</hi> remains in the bottom like a Snowy Sand, and is to be well purged by reiterated waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Water, ſo long until (all the impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being well ſeparated) the Powder it ſelf becomes like to the white Snow. He alſo adds that this may be ſo highly exalted as to be aſſociable to Gold; but the knowledge of a matter Precipitating <hi>Tartar</hi> is not eaſie to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, without which it will never ſuffer it ſelf to be precipitated and purged; 'tis an hard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62757:28"/>thing to find, but he that knows it, it renders him all his labour facile and eaſie. Any impure <hi>Tartar,</hi> whether it be white or red, may be ſo waſh'd in one or two hours ſpace and ſo Purged, that (loſing nothing ſave its <hi>Faeces</hi>) it will become moſt white, and much more apt for many Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe make ſuch fine Spirits of Wine without any violent Diſtillation, that thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits added to Water will make good Wines, if you again add in the depurated <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                     </q> You may alſo ſee, what he further ſays in <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 59. and <hi>P.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 292.</p>
                  <p>Now if you cannot attain to this Tartar, you muſt endeavour ſo to prepare your Spirits, as that they may be ſweet and pleaſant, though ſomething different in taſte from thoſe of the Vine, which taſte proceeds from the ſignature of that ſpecificated Sulphur, from whence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are prepared, which geneous Nature will preſerve what in her lies to the utmoſt <hi>Iliad;</hi> but ſtrong Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours come from the violence of Fire and Aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that the fault is not to be aſcribed to Nature, but to the Ignorance of the Artificer; ſeeing ſuch the ſame will happen, even from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of the Vine; therefore the skillful one muſt firſt bereave them of this taſte and ſmell; and then he may eaſily introduce ſuch others, as have a meaſurable Homogeniety and Affinity to the Vine; this, and this only, is the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Art, and the Artificial Preparation we would point forth; for (as we 've elſewhere ſaid) if Spirits were thus Stilled, ſo as to get an ill Tang, they muſt again be bereaved thereof,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62757:28"/>which is not accompliſhed till your Spirits are brought in a manner as free from taſte as Water, only Fiery and Spiritual; whereby much of the groſs Sulphur, from whence the aduſtion, and conſequently ill Tang, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, is caſt off, and ſeparated; we mean as to its domineering qualities. The like may be done to great content even on Rum, which is the ſtrongeſt in ſmell and taſte of all the Vinor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, drawn from Vegitable Concretes: Which taſte, we are well ſatisfied comes not ſo much from the Internal Natute of the Concrete, as from their rough Preparation of the ſame; ſc. their ſo often uſing the remains and reliques of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Canes; ſeeing that by pure Salts and great Quantities of freſh water, they are cleanſed therefrom, as a Leper is, when cleanſed from his defilements, and brought to a ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Spirit; which ſaid ſweetneſs cannot by all the Art imaginable, be equally produced from ſome other Spirits; ſeeing thoſe that proceed from the Vinor Root it ſelf are not equally indued with Fragrant, Rich, and Sweet <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For one Simple is naturally ſweeter than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; <hi>ex. gr.</hi> All ſweet Wines will naturally yield ſweet Spirits, and clear Wines yield abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſweeter Spirit than thoſe made from the Lees, although proceeding from one and the ſame veſſel; for Claret Wine gives by much a ſweeter Spirit than the <hi>Faeces</hi> or ſediment thereof, there being therein a more groſs and feculent Sulphur, the which corrupts their ſimple ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62757:29"/>which chiefly is to be preferred; wherefore do we eſteem the <hi>Glauberian way of Diſtilling,</hi> laid down in the fourth Head; becauſe the <hi>Low-wines</hi> and <hi>Proof Spirits</hi> come off from thence abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweeter than thoſe from Waſh: And, as the Author ſays, P. 1. pag. 159. <hi>may in all things be made to taſte like natural Brandy.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <hi>N. B.</hi>
                     </bibl> But if any man will give this Brandy a relliſh, like that made of the Lees of Wine, then he muſt rectify it upon the Lees of Wine; for this way by the Oyl of Wine, which is plentiful among the Lees, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires his ends, and in all things he may uſe this inſtead of that.</q>
                  <p>
                     <label>Objection</label> But ſome may ſay how can this poſſibly be ſo ſweet as that drawn from pure Wines, ſeeing that you but even now ſaid that thoſe gave a ſweeter Spirit than that drawn from the Lees?</p>
                  <p>But in Anſwer to theſe; We will not compare them with thoſe drawn from pure Wines but with ſuch as are drawn from Vinor Roots of a more inferiour Nature, and eſpecially from the Lees; becauſe theſe having their aduſtion on them, are apt to get a ſtronger ſmatch, being expoſed to the Fire, than ſuch Spirits will, which are already worked ſo pure, that in the Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they will only ſuck out the Volatile, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and pleaſant parts, as is evident in this. If thoſe Lees, from whence you have drawn your Spirits, be afterward Fermented, and then again Diſtilled, they will yield but little quantity of Spirit, and that deficient in its flavour; ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62757:29"/>that 'tis evident, that there is a difference of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical attraction and violent Diſtillation, the one bringing up only the Homogeneous parts, and the other ſending off the more groſs with the Volatile ones; and yet more if the Spirit you uſe is already ſweet and pleaſant, and the <hi>Argel</hi> by Art ſeparated from all its impure and terrene <hi>Faeces,</hi> as before mentioned: and again we ſee a conſiderable difference in ſuch Spirits, as are purified by ſuch Salts, as will Magnetically at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract their impurities and Aquacities; ſo that their Spirituality is ſeparated, and then Diſtilled; from ſuch Spirits, as are worked and rectified through the body of Salt in the Still; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' theſe may in ſome meaſure rob them of ſomething, yet again they alſo add ſomething of the Nature of that Salt, whence rectified, and therefore can't be ſo pure as the former; ſeeing they are worked by a ſimple intention, their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities being gone before they come into the Still.</p>
                  <p>You have a clear example in this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Bay Salt</hi> is uſed in the common Method of Rectification, <hi>Bay leaves, Orrice, Ginger, Mugwort, Prunes, Pellitory, all Spice, Tamarinds, Clary,</hi> &amp;c. Yet are not theſe Spirits by far ſo pleaſant, as thoſe, which are thus prepared.</p>
                  <p>Take of pure Indian Peter; and white Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, of each a Pound, the beſt Yellow Sulphur half a Pound, and being finely powder'd and mixed together, you may with a red hot Iron fire them, and when they will burn no more, melt them well in the fire, and when cold, pour them out into a Mortar, and pulverize
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62757:30"/>them very fine immediately, or elſe they will Magnetically attract the Air, and ſo not eaſily admit of pulverizating; theſe forthwith put into a Glaſs, and pour thereon two quarts of high proof Spirits, ſuch as you would bereave of their ſmell; and put them into a cold place for four or five days, remembering to ſhake them twice or thrice a day, then Filter them through a Cap-paper or Filtre, and draw off two third parts by Diſtillation in <hi>Bal. Mariae;</hi> and ſo have you your Spirit again, but of a wonderful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant taſte and ſmell, far above the former; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no Herbs are as yet added; and tho' this at the firſt appearance may not ſeem to you a thing of profit; yet it carries with it in its demonſtration ſuch great truths as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not only the Nature and Difference of theſe being ſo wrought, but alſo the poſſibility of meliorating and bettering ſuch things as are not drawn from the Products of the Vine; and its profits may alſo hereafter be conſiderably diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but in all this here is hitherto our miſhap; that we are forced to be beholding to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of Foreign Lands, whenas the thing, which muſt anſwer the grounded intention of this buſineſs, muſt proceed from ſomething, which is a proper Product of this Land; or elſe how ſhould we ſupply our ſelves with good wares in time of difficulty; and therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all Foreign things, as <hi>Tartar, Wine-Lees, Chryſtals, Verdigreeſe,</hi> or any <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> &amp;c. although we know that ſomething from theſe, if rightly prepared, may be performed, as well
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62757:30"/>as from common Sulphur or Sea Salt, and ſuch others as are aptly made, for the great buſineſs of Rectification; nay, we ſay from the Stone <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietes,</hi> or natural <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> being opened by the fixed Salts contained in Hermaphroditical ones, from whence proceeds a pleaſant Earth which to our knowledge is very homogeneous to Viner Spirits; for by it we are able before men of underſtanding to prepare better Stuff than hath hitherto been uſually done; although <hi>Concentrated Vinegar</hi> is not to be deſpiſed, if ſo imbodied, as to preſerve its Tartneſs in its Vitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; eſpecially if the Spirits are ſo Diſtilled as to retain their ſweet flavours; for as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid, from the tart and ſweet, together with the predominance of the Specificated Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, come the different flavours unto Viner Spirits; for if the ſweet hath the predominance, with the flavours of the <hi>Rhinal ſoyl,</hi> then the violet taſte is evidently diſcernable: but from the red mold of <hi>France,</hi> the tart gives the Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery taſte; and theſe again mixing give neutral and other pleaſant flavours, whoſe difference is eaſily diſcernable by curious palates, although it cannot be ſo exactly compared to what 'tis moſt like in flavour, ſeeing ſo many curious ones are intermixed; many things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be ſaid, ſeeing Nature is ſo bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and large in her gifts; even to the filling of many Sheets, and that with profit too to the Reader; but we muſt be forced to omit many things, leaſt the Treatiſe ſhould ſwell too big, wherein we deſign to be as conciſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62757:31"/>as may be; yet we think it needful to ſtir up the minds of the Ingenious to the ſearch of that, which by Trials may to their great content be meaſurably attained; for we know that Spirits prepared from the Products of this Land may be much bettered; for as we ſee 'tis no difficult matter to take the Garments off a poor man, and to give him richer; ſo is it the ſame in this Caſe, if we have a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Fountain of Nature; and if it is really ſo, as the Ancient Philoſophers teſtifie, <q>ſc. that in the Mineral Kingdom by help of the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> or Seed of Metals they can tranſmute all the impure ones into vendible <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna;</hi> why then may not the true <hi>Spagyriſt</hi> by help of the Univerſal Vegetable Seed take off the drowſie Nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> or Spirit of Barley, or the Airy Nature of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or Spirit of Fruits, and bring them into that friendly one of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Sun, to which the Vine belongs; ſeeing the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Tranſmutation is by the moſt Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Wits of this Age believed?</q> And there is hardly any one, that pretends to any thing of Art, but will argue for the ſame; and there have been given ſuch undeniable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of its verity, that we think it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility that any reaſonable man ſhould at this time of day doubt thereof; neither indeed have they the leaſt cauſe concerning this of meliorating and bettering Spirits, for if the Ingenious and Lovers of Art, and others that are unskilful in the ways of working, will but take the Method we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62757:31"/>preſcribe, they may in time therein become prompt perficients, becauſe we labour what in us lies, to encourage them to ſupply their own defects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which to do, let them thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Proof Spirits</hi> being well prepared, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably bereaved of their Maltiſh taſte, then charge therewith your Rectifying Still with a Can or two of Water according to their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and take any ſort of Herb you beſt like with your prepared Salt, and tie them up in a bag (called a Rectifying bag) and throw it into the Still, lute all faſt, and gently and warily draw off your <hi>Fine Goods.</hi> You muſt be very cautious of Fire and Candles, eſpecially where there is any breaking out of fume; leaſt they ſhould Fire, and ſo do a great deal of miſchief, for this Reaſon Rectification is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more dangerous than drawing <hi>Low-wines;</hi> therefore be not too haſty, but proceed warily and moderately, and govern it ſo that the ſtream may not run above the bigneſs of a large Crow Quill, or at moſt a ſmall Gooſe one; and you muſt obſerve not to let it run off too long; for the latter part of your Spirit will be apt to carry ſome of the ill ſavour with it to the great detriment of the former; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them be ſaved apart; the firſt for <hi>Brandies,</hi> the latter to <hi>be again Rectified ſo as to Fire Gunpowder, and then it may be uſed in Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, or elſe it may well ſerve for ſome Compound Waters.</hi> Now to know when all the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality is come over, you muſt proceed thus.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62757:32"/>Take a Taſter of that which runs in the left hand, and a lighted Candle in the right, throw it upon the Neck or Head of the Still at work, immediately putting the Candle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and if it fires and burns you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, otherwiſe your Operation is at an end. Now your firſt <hi>fine Spirits</hi> muſt be allayed into <hi>Proof</hi> or the ſtrength of <hi>Brandy</hi> with Liquor, for the which ſome make uſe of this following Water; They take <hi>Calx vive,</hi> and mix a ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saſſafras</hi> with it, and being put in a Tub they pour Spring Water thereon, and ſo letting it ſettle till very clear, then make uſe of it; but we are for making our Liquor by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling it through ſome Azural Salt; for then it freely mixes without the leaſt bubble, or white ſpeck, and ſeeming Precipitation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to <hi>Proof,</hi> it may be a little tinged with the Tincture of Saunders; and 'twill not be a miſs, if you add a ſmall portion of Spices in a bag, as Cinamon, Broad-Mace, and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs; and then have you good Saleable Wares, eſpecially if your <hi>Proof Spirits</hi> were truly prepared, and from a good <hi>Baſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if this tryal, although <hi>Good Wares,</hi> doth not in all things anſwer your expectation, then proceed to a ſecond or third, ſometimes with one ſort, and ſometimes with another, and in greater or leſſer quantity; nay you may mix two <hi>Species</hi> together, and ſo proceed in your Tryal till your end is anſwered; for your experiments will be little loſs or coſt to you, ſeeing if you proceed not irregularly, your Goods will be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62757:32"/>vendible; eſpecially if you obſerve but the rules laid down.</p>

And to thoſe already named, we will add Cherries without the Stones, <hi>Arſmart, Pepperwort,</hi> the Herb <hi>Scarleae,</hi> the <hi>Blackberry,</hi> firſt made into Wine, as directed, as alſo <hi>Wheat Corn;</hi> for from thence proceed moſt excellent flavours, as we know by large Experience; therefore accept of our plain and kind Communication, and by a few tryals you may hit the profitable truth; eſpecially if you over Doſe not the Spirit with the Herb; for do we not ſee how a few drops of the Oyl of <hi>Cinamon, Cloves</hi> and <hi>Mace,</hi> being dropt into Sugar and caſt into Wines, alter their taſte, eſpecially if ſome Eſſence of <hi>Ambergreeſe</hi> is added, as may be hereafter more largely ſhown in the next Impreſſion of our <hi>Britannean Magazine</hi> of <hi>Liquors;</hi> we alſo ſee that the Elder-flower caſt into well
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62757:33"/>decocted Mead, makes it juſt like Wine made of the Apian or Muskadine Grape: All which preſidents make clear the Art of Rectification, ſo that enough and more than enough is ſaid of this Nature; ſeeing the diligent hand muſt by trials obtain that, which may greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the ſatisfaction of the ſearcher; for doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>the diligent hand makes rich,</hi> which may be underſtood in Knowledge as well as Subſtance, ſince that he preferrs Wiſdom and Underſtanding before all the Riches and Glory of this World: ſaying, that <hi>Kings and Princes muſt come and throw down their Crowns and Scepters before it:</hi> And how can any man be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel another, if he have not ſome gifts above him, and a Practical knowledge in that, of which the other underſtands nothing? but into this part muſt every man enter by his own ſelf-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and unceſſant ſeeking and knocking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Divine Providence through his perſeverance opens it unto him: For we can neither lay, nor yet think of any Limitations in this Caſe; but as to what we have written we think it ſufficient for any rational <hi>Genius</hi> to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements on; and the more eſpecially ſeeing we have ſhown the Preparation of <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Salts</hi> in the ſecond Head, in the fourth Chapter, ſc. of noble ſpecificated Powers; as alſo in the third Head touched at the Office of our <hi>Sal Panariſtos,</hi> which will perform on Wines and Spirits all that the Artiſt can deſire; nay, even to the Superlative degree; and yet the radical Product of <hi>England;</hi> therefore did we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62757:33"/>in our firſt Part Metaphorically deſcribe the Actions of the Planets, in order to ſet forth this thing, and to ſhow that the Univerſal Spirit may have its pure <hi>Effluviums</hi> ſo concentrated, as to be brought into a Corporeal or Bodily Form; this is that, when ſo prepared, which hath power to tranſmute one Nature into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as Vulgar <hi>Venus</hi> will Cloath Pale-Faced <hi>Sol</hi> with a deeper and more beautiful Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo will our <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Preface of our <hi>Chymicus Rationalis,</hi> or rather our <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,</hi> be a <hi>Medium</hi> for the exalting of Spirits into a purer Nature; and how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſeeing the Vine is under the Signature of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Juice thereof, hath only from thence its ſweet Salt; but this hath the Virtue of all the Planets Concatinated into a pure ſweet and Chryſtaline Salt, the very Key to the Golden and Lunar Magnet, and other ſuch perfect ones, which by their internal puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will magnetically attract and ſeparate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities from other beings; and ſo doth this the Flegm and groſs Sulphur in Spirits, (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up by the Fire, cauſe their Nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſmell and taſte, and ſometimes faetid, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if burnt,) and ſo brings them to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate; but this cannot be ſo properly called a Tranſmutation of form, for that is a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out of one kind into another; as an Alteration or Melioration, from a more inferiour to a more ſuperior degree; but ſeeing the Original of this Salt together with its Office is ſhown in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62757:34"/>fourth Chapter, ſc. that of <hi>Powers,</hi> we ſhall thither referr you for it, and come to ſhow what remains, as pertinent to be treated of in this following part of the Chapter, ſc. <hi>The true way of preparing Simple Waters and Spirits;</hi> ſuch we mean as have no more than the Spirit and one ſingle entire Herb in them; becauſe in many caſes 'tis convenient to have their ſingle Virtues <hi>perſe,</hi> eſpecially where they are expected to operate according to their Simple Virtue, all laid down in the leſſer or leaſt Compoſition, ſc. three Gallons or one.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62757:87"/>not do it; for the Urinous Spirit muſt firſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of its faetor or ſtink, and ſecondly radically united with the Vinor and Oleous ones; the way to bereave it of its faetor is thus, take of pure <hi>Red-Wine</hi> two pound, and filtre exactly through a double Cap-paper, put it in digeſtion for ſeven days, pouring on now and then four or five ounces of Spirit of Wine diſtil'd from rich Aromaticks, and as it begins to ſmell very fragrant, put in a pound of common <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> that hath been diſſolved in the diſtilled waters of Aromatick-ſpices, exactly filtred and again boiled up into the body of Salt; which being therein diſſolved you muſt feed it as before with the Aromatick Spirit, adding thereunto of the Eſſential Oyl of Cinamon Guaiacum, and Saſſaphrax, of each half an ounce, and by a very gentle heat bring it to a dryneſs; the which Salt remove, and carefully preſerve, for tis of an ineſtimable value.</p>
                  <p>Then take Oyſter-ſhells, waſh them very clean, dry them, and Calcine them to an exceeding white <hi>Calx,</hi> the which power very finely, and ſift through a fine ſieve; then take of this, and the highly purifyed <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> of each a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, mix them well together, and put them into a Retort, and pour thereon twice their weight of the Alkalizated Spirit of that Concrete, whence you intend to make your <hi>Powers,</hi> and by degrees of fire diſtil to dryneſs, the ſpirit that comes over you may rectifie from a proportionable Quantity of dryed herbs, ſpices, or ſeeds, from whence you make your <hi>Powers</hi> or <hi>Oleoſum;</hi> and then unite
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62757:88"/>three pound thereof with half a pound of Eſſential Oyl by two or three Cohobations; or if your oyl is prepared as before directed, you may only ſhake them together and they ſhall be united; or in defect of this, you may do it by digeſtion, by adding in three or four ounces of our <hi>Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler,</hi> or <hi>Vegetable-preſerving-Salt;</hi> and ſo have you an <hi>Oleuſum</hi> or <hi>Powers</hi> ſuperiour to any as yet by others expoſed to ſale, being not only indued with the middle nature of the Concreate, but alſo an Abſterſive Vertue, as will be ſeen more at large hereafter; for what is here ſaid in general is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſignifie unto you the preparation and nature of thoſe <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Oleoſums</hi> prepared by the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphroditical Sal-Armoniack;</hi> we ſhall therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Particulars and firſt of,</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62757:95"/>Scurvey, becauſe the herb hath a ſignature againſt the Diſeaſe, it helps the Liver, Spleen, and other Viſcera in their Defects; it fortifies the vital Spirits and gives Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation to the Blood, its internal texture being made up of a Volatile Armoniack and Vinor Eſſence united with a vital medicinal Craſis, and as the Learned Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians allow, as well Modern as Ancient which that worthy Mrs. <hi>Experience</hi> daily confirms, there is no herb in the Vegetable Kingdom of a more Specifick Virtue in curing the Scurvey, than the aforeſaid Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey-graſs, for tis a great Abſterſive and ſo diſſolves and diſſipates congealed humours, for by its Alkaliſated nature it opens and mundifies, and by it's Vinor are the Venoms imbibed and deſtroyed, ſo by its carrying off all the Saline trude humours which are the Original Cauſe of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, whether proceeding from living in crude moiſt and foggy Airs, where the Sea-damps are, or from raw ſowr fruits, or exceeding Salt Fiſh or Fleſh, as is plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the incident of the Diſeaſeupon Seafaring-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſpecially ſuch as uſe long Voiages, it ſweetens the blood; this Spirit doth not only cure this Diſeaſe in all its Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, but alſo prevents it from approaching in ſuch as take it for prevention ſake, therefore in brief, what we have to ſay is, that it is indued with virtue to give Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the principal Faculties, and is a certain ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick both at Sea and Land where this popular Diſeaſe Reigns; as alſo in Camps and Armies againſt the Chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane and Rot, which are uſually there, by which men dye as Chore-ſheep.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62757:101"/>Spirit of its groſſer Sulphur, by which 'tis made very pure, yet it communicates to the Spirit but very little of it's own fixed nature; for as Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily demonſtrates the Saline, Abſterſive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Alkalie will not paſs into the Spirit till Volatilized; and as hath been already hinted in the beginning of this Chapter, they are not to be elivated but as they are radically united with their Eſſential Oyls, and Volatile Spirits, by means of the <hi>Diſpoſitio media,</hi> and that in ſuch a way as the Salts muſt thereby have ſwallowed up enough to aſſatiate their thirſt, the which is called <hi>Pondus naturae;</hi> and this is performed by humidations and exications, or by ſuccesful feeding, and as that ever worthy <hi>George Starkey</hi> ſaith, <hi>they muſt be dried by the Air, and moiſtned by the Fire, and Ferment of Nature, ſo by a gentle Decoction brought to a total Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,</hi> the which may either be diſtilled into a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or ſublimed into a Salt, as you pleaſe; But we ſay that you need not proceed ſo high; for when all the Principles are ſo united as readily to diſſolve under an highly Alkalizated Spirit; then by Diſtillation you will have the flavours brought over very rich and fragrant, and a ſweet Balſam remain behind, the which you muſt deflegm very carefully, and by Digeſtion unite with the Volatile Spirit: and then you have not only an <hi>Oleoſum</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Eſſence of that Concreat,</hi> whoſe Virtues are ſo noble, that they really will perform as much as can in Reaſon therefrom be expected as you ſhall ſee more at large in the following Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62757:103"/>and Vital Nature, both Contributing for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming real Cures; this is that Salt of Worm-wood, which <hi>Helmont</hi> ſays, <hi>is a true Specifick for the curing all kind of Feavers;</hi> Now what we further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in this Salt is, that it hath a communicative Ferment to all Herbs: for their macerated Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures being taken out (as we have ſhown in our <hi>Chymicus Rationalis</hi>) and Digeſted therewith in a Chicken heat, 'twill all in about twelve or fifteen days be converted into a Chriſtalline Salt, thus the Tincture of Worm-wood exalts its own Salt, and ſo the like of other Vegetables: Nay moreover by this way you may have a Salt of ſuch herbs, as will not by Diſtillation yield their Eſſential Oyls, as Hellebore, Jallop, Briony, Elecampane, and many others, nay even from Safron, and many things of a more gummous nature. Let this of the Eſſential Salt of Worm-wood ſuffice, ſeing therein are laid down rules ſufficient for the making as many more as you pleaſe; it being rather a common place than ſingle Receipt, for as <hi>Starkey</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> ſay, in the learning of one, you learn to make all.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to know the goodneſs and true Preparation of this Salt is thus, in the firſt place 'tis very ſweet and fragrant, ſmelling ſtrong of the Eſſential Oyl, whence made, without having the leaſt urinous ſcent: Secondly, 'twill readily diſſolve in water, without making the ſame muddy; and boyl up again without the leaſt loſs of Virtue: Thirdly, 'tis totally Volatile, as is evident in this, that being caſt upon a Red-hot plate of Iron, it will fume all away, without leaving the leaſt grain

Mag.</hi> where we ſaid that fixed Salts, burning Spirits and Eſſential Oyls muſt be United, Diſtilled, and Coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, until brought over in a Balſamick Spirit, which being imbodied into an Eſſential Salt plainly manifeſts its <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> or drying enriching Sulphur, which gives Life and Sulphurous Fatneſs, durable, laſting, and ſubſtantial Virtues to Wine, exalting both its Taſt and Smell; thus the Salt or Eſſence of Worm-wood will make rich Wormwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine; the like will that of Mint, Bawm and Angelica, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It alſo gives Fermentation thereunto and makes pure Wine indeed, like that refined from its Lees, giving it ſuch qualities as deſerve the higheſt Commendations, as we could by undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62757:104"/>Reaſons in Philoſophy prove, nay more than this, it exalts Spirits, giving them the taſt and flavour of the herb, and makes Powers without any more difficulty.</p>
                  <p>The manner of its being uſed is thus, Take an ounce thereof, and in a gentle heat diſſolve it in a Pint of the Wine, which you intend to enrich, and then with two or three ounces of Sugar, caſt it into what quantity of Wine you pleaſe, as you will have it ſmaller or richer in Taſt, Smell, and Vertue; but for Spirits, take theſe Salts, and pour upon them, of the ſaid Spirit, and then digeſting in a gentle heat, the Spirit by refuſion or pouring off, as often as it is tinged, will extract the whole Tincture of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, leaving the Salt behind robbed of the ſame, from whence it may be gathered, that the Salt and Tincture are centrally diſtinct, tho they have centrally wrought each on the other; this Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture you may add into your Spirits, and ſo will they thereby be truly enriched; Thus from Clary you may obtain the moſt noble Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hath hitherto been uſed among the Exalters of Wine; and ſo of others. For which Communication you ought to be thankful unto the great Creator, who hath given me a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind you-ward, and not deſpiſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, who is yet inclined to your further Service by proceeding to the third Head, <hi>ſc.</hi>
